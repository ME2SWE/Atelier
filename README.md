Team Objectives: Deliver a fully functional web application that meets the specifications and requirements outlined by project stakeholders. Work together on a single code base by dividing up the work among team members but working collaboratively to produce a single front end application. Integrate your front end with the existing API for the product, and demonstrate your working application at the end of the project timeline.
