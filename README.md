## Team Objectives:
Deliver a fully functional web application that meets the specifications and requirements outlined by project stakeholders. Work together on a single code base by dividing up the work among team members but working collaboratively to produce a single front end application. Integrate your front end with the existing API for the product, and demonstrate your working application at the end of the project timeline.

## Description:
Welcome to Team Skyfall's Atelier FEC Project! This is a web application that mimics a shopping website product page. These are the functions that have been implemented:
- Browse images, 'favorite' a product, and add a product to a shopping cart
- Current product-related items and their images
- Browse any questions and their corresponding answers about the product, search any question, add question, and add answer to a question
- Checkout reviews on the current product, filter the reviews, and add new review

## Installation:
To install all the required dependencies, open your terminal, go to the correct directory where the files are saved: 
type `npm install`

To start the server, inside the console/terminal:
type 'npm run server-dev'

To start the client, inside the console/terminal:
type 'npm run client-dev'
