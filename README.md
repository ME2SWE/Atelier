## Team Objectives:
Deliver a fully functional web application that meets the specifications and requirements outlined by project stakeholders. Work together on a single code base by dividing up the work among team members but working collaboratively to produce a single front end application. Integrate your front end with the existing API for the product, and demonstrate your working application at the end of the project timeline.

## Description:
Welcome to Team Skyfall's Atelier FEC Project! This is a web application that mimics a shopping website product page. These are the functions that have been implemented:
- Browse images, 'favorite' a product, and add a product to a shopping cart
- See Current product-related items and their images

- Checkout reviews on the current product, filter the reviews, and add new review
